                I'm a JavaScript, React.js, and Rails web developer based in Seattle with some experience in Python, Java (and Android), C++, and PHP. I started programming in 2010 at the University of Michigan and have been involved with tech ever since. Whether working in the industry or spending my free time and days off learning a new language, or teaching myself to make Android Apps. My brain craves the challenge of learning and problem solving while having a tangible result to be proud of. I have an artistic side with terrible painting skills so I express my creativity through design and photography.
